            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classical dance refers to traditional dance forms that have a rich historical and cultural heritage, characterized by their formalized movements, techniques, and aesthetic principles. These dance styles often require years of rigorous training and discipline to master.
                <br>
                India has a rich tradition of classical dance, each style rooted in regional history, mythology, and cultural practices. Here are the main classical dance forms of India:
            </p>
            <h3 align="center">BHARATANATYAM</h3>
            <hr align="center" width="505px;" align="left" noshade>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of Bharatanatyam is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of this art form. Bharatanatyam originated from the text Natya Shastra and grew roots in temples with the intent of deepening the religious experience. From its sacred origins in temple rituals to its resurgence as a revered classical dance, Bharatanatyam continues to enchant audiences with its beauty, grace, and profound storytelling. It remains an integral part of India's cultural heritage, embodying the rich traditions and artistic expressions of the land.
                The theoretical structure of Bharatanatyam is known as ‘Sadir,’ and traces back to the foundational text on artistic expression, Natya Shastra. Legends of Lord Brahma reveal him as the creator of Bharatanatyam, who performed the dance to sage Bharata, who in turn wrote the dance form into the Natya Shastra. The practice of the Bharatanatyam style got its start in South Indian temples, where Devadasi (dancers dedicated to serving the Lord as servants) performed this dance along with spoken services. Dated back to 300 BCE, this was the original performance style of Bharatanatyam

            <h3 align="center">KATHAK</h3>
            <hr align="center" width="530px;" align="center" noshade>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term Kathak is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word ‘Katha’ which means "story", and Kathakar which means "the one who tells a story". Wandering Kathakars or the traveling bards conveyed tales, inspired by our ancient epics and mythologies, through dance, songs, and music.  

                Kathak performers exhibit stories through graceful hand movements, extensive footwork, flexible body movements, and most importantly intense facial expressions capable of evoking a range of emotions. Kathak evolved during the Bhakti movement and incorporated stories revolving around the Hindu deity Krishna and his childhood.
            </p>
            <h3 align="center">ODISSI</h3>
            <hr align="center" width="530px;" align="center" noshade>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odissi dance is marked with graceful postures, emotive facial expressions, bright costumes, and makeup. The dancer uses intricate hand gestures to convey emotions, depict various characters, and tell stories. The versatile footwork complimenting the rhythm and music adds to the fluidity and expressiveness of the dance form.

                Odissi was predominantly performed by women who presented stories in the form of dance-dramas in praise of Lord Vishnu. Through the many crests and falls of time, this art form transited from the temples to the dance institutes run by sincere pursuers, practitioners, and teachers who trained their future generations to keep this artform alive, and finally to the world stage - as an emblem of India's rich cultural heritage.

            <h3 align="center">KATHAKALI</h3>
            <hr align="center" width="530px;" align="center" noshade>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students of Kathakali have to undergo rigorous training replete with oil massages and separate exercises for eyes, lips, cheeks, mouth and neck. Abhinaya or expression is of prime importance as is nritya or dance and geetham or singing.

                Kathakali said to have evolved from other art forms like Kutiyattam, Krishnanattam and Kalaripayattu. Kerala Kalamandalam is among the foremost centres for Kathakali training in the traditional way.

            <h3 align="center">KUCHIPUDI</h3>
            <hr align="center" width="530px;" align="center" noshade>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kuchipudi is a classical Indian dance form that originated in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. It is named after the village of Kuchipudi in Andhra Pradesh, where it was first performed.

                The dance form is characterized by its intricate footwork, graceful movements, and subtle facial expressions. It incorporates both pure dance (Nritta) and expressive dance (Nritya) elements, as well as storytelling through dance (Natya).

                Kuchipudi has a rich history, with its origins dating back to the 3rd century BCE. It was originally performed by a group of itinerant actors known as Bhagavathalu, who would travel from village to village, performing plays and dances based on Hindu mythology.

                Over time, Kuchipudi evolved into a more refined and sophisticated art form, with the development of a distinct style and technique. Today, it is recognized as one of the eight classical dance forms of India and is performed both within India and internationally.

                Kuchipudi performances typically begin with an invocation to the gods, followed by a series of pure dance sequences, expressive dance sequences, and storytelling through dance. The themes of the performances often draw from Hindu mythology, with the dancers portraying various gods, goddesses, and other mythological characters.

            <hr align="center" width="530px;" align="center" noshade>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manipuri classical dance is a traditional classical dance form that originated in the northeastern Indian state of Manipur. It is known for its grace, fluidity, and delicate movements. These are inspired by the rich cultural traditions and religious practices of Manipur. Manipuri dance is deeply rooted in the Vaishnavite tradition. It is often performed as a devotional offering to Lord Krishna. The dance form is characterized by its gentle footwork, hand gestures (mudras), expressive facial expressions, and elaborate costumes that include vibrant traditional attire and intricate jewelry.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western dance, history of Western dance from ancient times to the present and including the development of ballet, the waltz, and various types of modern dance.

                The peoples of the West—of Europe and of the countries founded through permanent European settlement elsewhere—have a history of dance characterized by great diversity and rapid change. Whereas most dancers of the East repeated highly refined forms of movement that had remained virtually unchanged for centuries or millennia, Western dancers showed a constant readiness, even eagerness, to accept new vehicles for their dancing. From the earliest records, it appears that Western dance has always embraced an enormous variety of communal or ritual dances, of social dances enjoyed by many different levels of society, and of skilled theatrical dances that followed distinct but often overlapping lines of development.

            <h3 align="center">SALSA</h3>
            <hr align="center" width="505px;" align="left" noshade>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salsa dance is a lively and vibrant partner dance that originated in the Caribbean, with its roots deeply embedded in the Afro-Cuban and Afro-Caribbean dance traditions. The evolution of salsa is a fascinating journey that involves a rich blend of cultural influences and historical developments.

                Salsa dance has strong ties to Cuban music and dance styles, particularly the son, rumba, and Afro-Cuban traditions. In the mid-20th century, the major influx of Cuban migrants to the United States led to their interaction with other Caribbean and Latin American communities. It led to a melting pot of cultural influences that began to shape the emerging salsa scene.

            <h3 align="center">HIP-HOP</h3>
            <hr align="center" width="505px;" align="left" noshade>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hip-hop culture developed to voice the struggles of the Afro-Americans and Latino communities in Bronx, New York City, during the 1970s. The hip-hop culture gave rise to different street-style music, dance, and arts.

                Hip-hop dance serves as a powerful form of self-expression and identity for its practitioners, allowing them to convey their personal stories, emotions, and perspectives through movement.

                Hip-hop encompasses a wide range of styles, including breaking, locking, popping, and more. Each style has its distinct movements, techniques, and cultural influences, contributing to the diversity within the broader hip-hop dance umbrella.

            <h3 align="center">JAZZ DANCE</h3>
            <hr align="center" width="505px;" align="left" noshade>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jazz music and dance bear a lot of ethnic influence. If we trace the history of Jazz, we find that the beats and movements were brought to America by African slaves. The bent knee postures, pulsating movements, body isolation, foot stamping, and clapping of the hands are very typical of African dance. Once these dance and music were prohibited by the Slave Act in 1740. However, later, in the 19th century, the whites started enjoying the African style of music and dance and performed them in minstrel shows.
 
                The Africans then traveled to Europe and introduced a new version of Jazz music and dance. In the 20th century, this dance form interacted more with European music and dance styles such as ballet, and Irish jig to bring about variations in the dance styles. Thus, the dance style evolved making its mark in clubs and theaters. Later, it even got featured in Broadway theatres and Hollywood films.

            <h3 align="center">DISCO DANCE</h3>
            <hr align="center" width="505px;" align="left" noshade>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that comes to mind by the very mention of the word - Disco is flashy lights, dancers in flashy sequined dresses, grooving to highly rhythmic songs on the dance floor of clubs or discotheques, and a disco ball hanging from the ceiling.

                Disco is primarily a couple dance that features synchronized movements, spins, and turns, creating a dynamic and social dance experience. The dance steps bear the heavy influence of Latin dance styles such as Salsa and cha-cha which was evident in the footwork and other body movements.

                Disco's legacy is seen in its influence on street and club dances, and its adaptability has left a lasting impact on social and partner dancing. Elements of disco dance, especially footwork and spins, continue to influence street dance styles such as hip-hop and funk.

            <h3 align="center">BALLET DANCE</h3>
            <hr align="center" width="505px;" align="left" noshade>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ballet, with its origins in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century, evolved from courtly social dances. It gained structure and form in France during the 17th century, notably with the contributions of King Louis XIV and the establishment of the Académie Royale de Danse. 

                The evolution of ballet continued through the 18th and 19th centuries, marked by the development of narrative storytelling, technical innovations, and the emergence of renowned ballets like "Swan Lake" and "The Nutcracker." 

                The 20th century witnessed the rise of neoclassical and contemporary ballet, challenging traditional forms. Today, ballet remains a classical art form while embracing diversity and innovation in choreography and technique, with influential companies and choreographers pushing the boundaries of this timeless dance style.

            <h3 align="center">BREAK DANCE</h3>
            <hr align="center" width="505px;" align="left" noshade>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakdance, or breaking, originated in the South Bronx, New York City, during the 1970s as a fundamental element of hip-hop culture. Influenced by diverse dance forms like martial arts, gymnastics, and funk styles, breaking emerged as a dynamic and improvisational street dance.

                The popularity that Breakdancing acquired in the early days was the contribution of the early breakers such as DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaataa. Besides them, there were dance crews such as the Rock Steady Crew and the New York City Breakers.

                The dance style is characterized by popping, locking, intricate footwork, freezing, and acrobatic moves that involve spinning on the floor and other dynamic dance moves. Breakdancing places a strong emphasis on individual expression and creativity.
